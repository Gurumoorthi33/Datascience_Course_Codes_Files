Unsupervised Learning

It is the process of finding or predicting the output without knowing target label.
We will be having set of inputs without any label.
So using various clustering method we will be the finding the suitable group and label for that.

Types of Clustering:

1. Kmeans Clustering.
2. Hierarchical Clustering.

Clustering is the process of grouping the data which is scattered along the area.

Kmeans --> Euclidean distance.

Steps:

we define the cluster k value, k = 2 means it will two clusters.
we then appoint the centroids for each clusters.
We pick and  check the closest clusters and whatever it is near by , put the data into the clusters.

Code explanation:


Hierarchical Clustering:
1. Agglomerative Hierarchical clustering(bottom up).
2. Divisive Hierarchical Clustering(Top down).

1. Agglomerative Hierarchical clustering(bottom up).

step 1: It consider each data point as a clusters.
step 2: Merges the closest pair of clusters iteratively.
step 3: "ward" distance metrics. (minimizes the clusters variance).
step 4: It forms the level of clustering.

Linkage():

Is is the key components of hierarchical clustering.
Is is needed to show the hierarchical clustering as it forms hierarchical clustering.
by calculating the  distance between each clusters.
linkage matrix is also be called as linkage method.
Further, linkage() methods has various methods inbuilt to use.

linkage(x, "single")
linkage(x, "complete")
linkage(x, "average")
linkage(x, "ward")
