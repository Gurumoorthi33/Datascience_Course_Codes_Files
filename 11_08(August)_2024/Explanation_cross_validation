Train and Test:

cross validation:

cv = 5

kFold, cv = 5

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score

data = pd.read_csv()

x = data[[]]
y = data[]

model = LinearRegression()
x_train,x_test,y_train,y_test = train_test_split(x,y,test_size = 0.2, random_state = 32)
cross_val_check = cross_val_score(model,x_train,y_train,cv = 5, random_state = 42,scoring = "r2")
print(cross_val_score.best_score_)

model.fit(x_train,Y_train)
prediction = model.predict(y_test)

Types:

1. kFold                          ----> Linear, Logistic
2. Stratified K-Fold              ----> Logistic
3. leave One out Cross Validation ----> Linear, Logistic
4. Group K Fold Cross Validation  ----> Linear, Logistic

Data distribution: Balanced data and Imbalanced data

Balanced Data:

1. Each class in the target variable approximately the same number of samples
2. The distribution of classes is relatively even. no extra data

Unbalanced Data:

1. Some class will have more samples than others.
2. The distribution of the class is not even.
