Regularization is the process to overcome the problem of overfitting.

problem of overfitting is that it brings too much noise and also to be the part of the output

overfitting can be reduced by introducing some penalty or making some column to zero or picking only few columns.

Regularization Mechanism:

1. L1 Regularization -  Lasso
2. L2 Regularization -  Ridge
3. Elastinet
4. Dropout
5. Early Stopping

Usages:

1. it helps in model perform better on unseen data.
2. reduces overfitting.
3. feature selection.

When to apply these Algorithm;

1. Linear and logistic Regression:
L1 and L2

2. Neural Networks:
dropout

3. Support Vector Machine:
C parameter

4. DecisionTree:
pruning, Regularization

5. Clustering:
Regularization, pruning
