Model Type:
Supervised and unsupervised

1. Supervised:
       means we will having some x data and target y data
       x data can be single or multiple

    Types:
     Linear_model:
        1. LinearRegression(where the output is continuous)
        2. LogisticRegression(Where the output is discrete(Binary))
        Note: Even though Logistic find the categorical output still we categorize this as a regression because it
              follows linearity along the input data.

     Linear and Non_Linear model:
            Classification:
                 DecisionTree(Regressor or Classifier)
                 RandomForest(Regressor or Classifier)
                 Support Vector Machine(Regressor or Classifier(most used))
                 KNN(K Nearest Neighbour)
                 Naive Bayes(Probability Based prediction

     Mechanism of code execution:
            1. Take the Dataset.
            2. Read the Dataset through the python.
            3. Do the preprocessing and keep the data clean.
                3.1 preprocessing includes EDA, Data Wrangling, Feature Engineering.
            4. Train and test the data.
                4.1 train the data with 80% and test teh with 20%
                4.2 If model produces the poor result then do the following.
                    4.2.1 Cross Validation
                        4.2.1.1  K-Fold , Stratified K-Fold, (many more...)
                        Note_1: Choose K-Fold for linear and choose stratified for classification
                        Note_2: It is advised to go for stratified if the data is Imbalanced
                        Note_3: When the Target data is not equal with respect with proportion then that is called
                                as unbalanced data
                        If cross Validation still produces the poor results do the following:
