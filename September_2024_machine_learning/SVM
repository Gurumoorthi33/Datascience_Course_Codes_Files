1. It forms a hyperline to data to separate and it classifies the data.
2. It is Used for both regressor and classifier.
3. It can be also used for outlier detection.
4. It assigns the data to the given category.
5. Non-probabilistic binary linear classifier.


Hyperplane:

it is the decision boundary to do the classification.

Support Vector:

Data  points that is close to the hyperplane. This helps in separation.

Margin:

inbetween gaps.

kernel(deciding linear or curved):

Linear, sigmoid, polynomial
