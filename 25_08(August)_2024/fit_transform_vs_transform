fit_transform(x)
- Combines two actions: fitting (learning from x) and then transforming it.
- Used on the training data because it:
- Learns the internal patterns/statistics (e.g., calculates polynomial terms or scaling parameters).
- Applies the transformation immediately after learning.
- Think of it like:
"Study your textbook thoroughly (fit), then write the test based on what you've learned (transform)."
ðŸ”„ transform(x)
- Only applies the transformation, using parameters learned from the previous fit.
- Used on test data or new unseen data, to ensure consistency:
- Doesnâ€™t learn anything newâ€”just uses the same logic/patterns captured during training.
