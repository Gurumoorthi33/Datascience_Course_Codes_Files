1. KNN by default involves expensive computation because it calculates distance for every points in the datasets
2. so if it is smaller datasets , go for KNN
3. when data is on thousand range
4. this is useful when we have similar scales (normally distributed)
5. It is a non-parametric method
6. It is used for recommendation system.
7. It can handle non-Linear Data
