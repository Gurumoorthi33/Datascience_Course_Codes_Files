Age   Weight   height
5       12       4cm
6       20       4cm
7       23       4cm
25      45       4cm
6       10       4cm

On the above height doesn't play an role and it is nullified

If the variance is set as'0' then it is called as no influence.

Note:

variance is the process of finding the data how much it got deviated from the actual mean of that column

Supervised learning and unsupervised learning are both machine learning techniques that use different types of data to learn and make predictions.
Supervised learning
Unsupervised learning
Data
Labeled data with known output values
Unlabeled data without known output values
Goal
Learn to map input data to output data
Discover patterns and insights in data
Examples of supervised learning Image and speech recognition, Fraud detection, Recommendation systems, Medical diagnosis, and Spam filtering.

points to be remembered:
             Eigen values and Eigen vectors

standardised means which have 0 mean and 1 standard deviation
