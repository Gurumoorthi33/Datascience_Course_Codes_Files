Time Series Analysis:

It is  the method to analyze the time series data in the order to extract meaningful stats.
It is used to predict or find the future values based on the previously observed.

Point:

It has two ways to apply:

1. Stationary    ---> Mean, Variance, co-efficient

Uses: It is used for the forecasting.

Example: ADF method
Augmented Dickey Filler Method.

2. Non-Stationary.

Notes:

1. UniVariate: ---- Daily stock
2. MultiVariate --- Temperature,  Rain forecast

Components:

1. Trend ---> Upward, Downward.
2. Seasonality ---> Season, Repeat Pattern, cycle.
3. Noise/irregularity ---> Random Variation.
4. AutoCorrection -------> correlation between the time series with its own past data.

Forecasting Mechanism:

1. Naive Forecasting.

Method: It is easiest and simplest from of forecasting where,  next value is assumed to be same as the last
observed(lagged) value.

EX: 12c with 12c in today.

naive_forecasting = df["value"].iloc[-1]

2. Moving Average:

Method: Averages based on past  few observations to smooth our fluctuation and highlight longer terms.

moving_average = df["values"].rolling(window = 7).mean()

3. Simple Componential smoothing:

Method: It takes previous data or lagged observations but it gives more weightage to recent one.


4. AR(Auto Regressor):

Method: A linear model that predicts the future based on the past value of the same variable.

Data: Stationary

ARIMA: It picks the data by incorporating the influence of past forecast errors on the current prediction.
